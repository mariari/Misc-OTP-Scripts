* Misc OTP Scripts

Welcome to my poor code in Elixir and Erlang. Currently this repo just
contains Elixir code, and not much at that. Hopefully in time some
interesting code will populate its contents

** Installation

If [[https://hex.pm/docs/publish][available in Hex]], the package can be installed
by adding =misc= to your list of dependencies in =mix.exs=:

#+begin_src elixir
  def deps do
    [
      {:misc, "~> 0.1.0"}
    ]
  end
#+end_src

Documentation can be generated with [[https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc][ExDoc]]
and published on [[https://hexdocs.pm][HexDocs]]. Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/misc_elixir_scripts>.

** Testing
Sadly Elixir has rather poor tooling on this part.

#+begin_src elixir
  % MIX_ENV=test iex -S mix

  iex(1)> Mix.Tasks.Test.run([])
  iex(2)> r MiscTest
  iex(3)> Mix.Tasks.Test.run([])
#+end_src

- You will have to reload the tests after each run as mix caches it,
  and you must run it from a testing environment or else it will
  refuse to load the tests
